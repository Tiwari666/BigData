# Big Data Project: Exploring and Analyzing Large-Scale JSON Data Using PySpark and Machine Learning

Overview

This project demonstrates how to process, analyze, and build machine learning models on large-scale JSON data using PySpark and Python. The goal is to provide a step-by-step guide that is both beginner-friendly and robust enough for technical users. By leveraging PySpark, we ensure scalability and efficiency in handling big data, while integrating Python’s simplicity for machine learning workflows. This project is ideal for non-technical users, students, and professionals looking to learn and implement big data techniques in their work.

# Key Features

--Big Data in JSON Format: The dataset contains millions of rows in JSON format, mimicking real-world challenges of unstructured and semi-structured data.

--Use of PySpark: PySpark is utilized for efficient big data processing, allowing handling of data too large for a single machine.

--Machine Learning Integration: Includes feature engineering, training machine learning models, and evaluating predictions.

--Step-by-Step Instructions: The repository provides clear instructions, making it accessible for non-technical users.

--Scalability: Designed to showcase big data principles, preparing users to transition to tools like Hadoop and cloud-based solutions.

# Prerequisites

--Google Colab or Local Environment: Ensure access to Google Colab or a local machine with PySpark installed.

--Dataset: A large-scale JSON dataset. For this project, the dataset is available on Kaggle.

--Python Libraries: Ensure the following libraries are installed: pyspark, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.


# Project Objectives

--A) Data Exploration and Preparation:

----Load and process a JSON dataset using PySpark.

----Explore and clean the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.

--B) Big Data Transformations:

---Perform RDD transformations and actions to extract insights from the data.

---Group and aggregate data efficiently.

---C) Feature Engineering:

---Extract and preprocess text data from columns such as "Abstract" and "Title."

--Vectorize the text data for machine learning.

--D) Machine Learning Analysis:

---Train and evaluate a machine learning model to classify or predict categories.

---Interpret model results and evaluate performance.

--E) Scalability and Real-World Applicability:

---Showcase how PySpark and Hadoop principles can be applied for scalable solutions.


# Project Workflow

A) Data Loading:

---Load a large JSON file into PySpark as an RDD and DataFrame.

B) Data Exploration:

Check for missing values and duplicates.

Display column summaries and sample rows.

C) Data Cleaning:

--Remove duplicates and rows with missing values.

--Optimize data storage by sampling and caching intermediate results.

D) Feature Engineering:

--Tokenize text data (e.g., abstracts).

--Remove stopwords and vectorize using HashingTF.

--Encode target labels for machine learning.

E) Model Building:

--Split the dataset into training and test sets.

--Train a Logistic Regression model using PySpark.

--Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy.

F) Visualization and Insights:

---Display results and insights using visualization libraries.


















# CLI (Command Line Interface):

A CLI is like talking to our computer through text. Instead of clicking buttons or icons, we can type commands to tell the computer what to do. It's similar to sending text messages, but we're giving instructions to our computer.

For example, if we want to see a list of files in a folder, we might type ls or dir in the command line, and the computer will show us the list.

It's a powerful way to control our computer, especially for tasks that need precision and speed.

# Examples

--CLI Commands:

--files.upload(): Opens a dialog to upload files in Google Colab.

--!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle: Creates a .kaggle directory using a terminal command.

--!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/: Copies the kaggle.json file to the .kaggle directory.

--!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json: Sets permissions for the kaggle.json file.

--!kaggle datasets list: Lists available datasets on Kaggle.

--!kaggle datasets download -d Cornell-University/arxiv: Downloads a dataset.

--!unzip arxiv.zip: Unzips the downloaded dataset.

--!apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk-headless -qq > /dev/null: Installs Java using a terminal command.

--!pip install pyspark: Installs PySpark using pip command.



# API (Application Programming Interface):

An API is like a waiter in a restaurant. We (the user) tell the waiter what we want, and the waiter (API) goes to the kitchen (server) to get it for us. It’s a way for different software applications to talk to each other.

Example: When we use a travel app to book a flight, the app uses an API to get flight information from the airline's database. We don’t see the data fetching process; we just see the results.

# Examples: API Usage:

---kaggle.datasets.download(): Downloads datasets by interfacing with the Kaggle API.
