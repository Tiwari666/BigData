# CLI (Command Line Interface):

A CLI is like talking to our computer through text. Instead of clicking buttons or icons, we can type commands to tell the computer what to do. It's similar to sending text messages, but we're giving instructions to our computer.

For example, if we want to see a list of files in a folder, we might type ls or dir in the command line, and the computer will show us the list.

It's a powerful way to control our computer, especially for tasks that need precision and speed.

# API (Application Programming Interface):

An API is like a waiter in a restaurant. We (the user) tell the waiter what we want, and the waiter (API) goes to the kitchen (server) to get it for us. It’s a way for different software applications to talk to each other.

Example: When we use a travel app to book a flight, the app uses an API to get flight information from the airline's database. We don’t see the data fetching process; we just see the results.
